# UCI-Communities-Crime-Data-Analysis-and-Bias-Reduction
Artificial intelligence is rapidly making its mark in all sectors of the society. But the safety and
ethical concerns of these models are still questionable. While some can enhance efficiency, the
context in which the model is used greatly determines its impact, especially in sensitive areas like
criminal justice. According to the EU AI act, risks associated are categorized into four tiers, and
assessing criminal risks comes under the top tier of unacceptable risks. So, is it really worth using
AI for criminal justice?
This assignment aims to analyse the UCI communities and crime dataset to understand the
underlying biases. By unveiling these biases, the aim is to evaluate the ethical viability of the dataset,
and also to propose strategies to enhance fairness, equity, and transparency in the model.

The bias mitigation is done using AIF360 tool.
